import GlobalCallout from '@/app/resources/components/callouts';

Emails are triggered after a visitor submits a form. The function that initiates this service (`SendEmail()`) is called as part of the form&rsquo;s submission handling process. The email service gets access to the data from the form submission by passing the form submission&rsquo;s response data as a parameter in the `SendEmail()` function call.

This parameter represents an object that contains all the information needed to send an email.

## Integrations

These emails are built using [React Email](https://react.email/) and deployed through the [SendGrid Mail Send API](https://docs.sendgrid.com/api-reference/mail-send/mail-send) (with some help from the [NodeJS Helper Library](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-nodejs)).

### React Email

The React Email library makes creating emails as easy as writing a React component. For a project that&rsquo;s fully managed with React components, this makes the process of creating custom emails a lot less cumbersome. (This process can be quite daunting otherwise.)

Styles are applied to emails with style objects that look similar to this:

```javascript
const logo = {
  width: 'auto',
  maxHeight: '50px',
  margin: 'auto',
};
```

<GlobalCallout
  message='While using [Tailwind is supported by React Email](https://react.email/docs/components/tailwind) and is used throughout the rest of this project, that system supports styling concepts that are not supported in some email clients. Using Tailwind is of interest, but more research is needed.'

The object is applied to a `style` prop on a [React Email component](https://react.email/docs/components). This is similar to how you would apply a class to an HTML element in traditional web development. These components simplify the process of coding emails that render properly in the most common browsers.

React Email compiles TSX files to email friendly HTML and plain text.

### SendGrid

SendGrid is the system powering the email sending infrastructure. Emails are sent from the `johnhodge.com` domain, and hyperlinks in emails are routed through `email.johnhodge.com`. These hyperlinks add tracking functionlity that sends measurement data back to SendGrid.

The current use of SendGrid is specifically focused on sending emails over API from events in the website. There are no marketing campaigns sending emails.

## Logo src and srcset use

The email currently in use has one image in it. The recipeint&rsquo;s email client has the ability to use a lightweight and infinitely scalable SVG or a PNG.

To use the SVG, the email client needs to...:

- support the SVG file type. SVG markup isn&rsquo;t being used, so the client has to be able to parse a file.
- support `srcset`. The `src` attributes passes a PNG because that filetype is supported by almost all clients, the SVG is available in the [`srcset`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement/srcset).

Clients that support HTML should also support `src` attributes in `img` elements, so sending the PNG in the `src` attribute should act as a good default for all clients.

<GlobalCallout
  message='SVG is only supported in [about 60% of email clients](https://css-tricks.com/a-guide-on-svg-support-in-email/), and it&rsquo;s unsupported by some major clients, like Gmail (in web browsers and the iOS app).'

Both image types are visible on light or dark themes.

- PNG uses an icon with a white background (similar to the favicon on this website)
- SVG is a black logo with a white outline and a transparent background

## Plain text support

Emails are sent in both HTML and plain text for cleints that can&rsquo;t render HTML.

SendGrid makes this pretty easy by supporting both [HTML and plain text](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-nodejs/tree/main/packages/mail#quick-start-hello-email) variations in the email&rsquo;s options. When the email is triggered to send, SendGrid automatically creates a multi-part MIME email with the plain text and HTML data.
