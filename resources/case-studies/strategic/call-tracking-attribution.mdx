This study discusses how we combined frictionless conversion paths with strategic CRM administration to increase conversions and sales revenue with deterministic tracking and regular sales enablement touchpoints.

## Star Analysis

This STAR analysis (situation, task, action, result) explains the product development work involved in creating click-to-call conversion points.

### Situation

<GlobalCallout message='Give context about the problem' type='note' />

We were working with a client that was primarily a B2C brand and paid our agency a commission on the ad budget. There was no retainer capacity allocated to the media strategy on this account. This was unlike most accounts we held, and this client was a test case for this pricing method.

Any friction in a conversion path can create attrition and result in leads being missed and sales not being captured. While we had strong conversion paths that would drive ad clicks to informative landing pages, we lacked quick, frictionless conversion points that could occur directly on the ad itself. Our advertisement campaigns were performing reasonably well, but using a shorter conversion path could increase conversions and, as a result, justify a larger ad budget (which is obviously attractive to both the client and our agency).

But simply setting up shorter conversion paths wouldn’t solve all our problems. Even if we were to set up quick, frictionless conversion points, we lacked the infrastructure needed to track those conversions and attribute sales to them. This would require some integration work and sales collaboration.

### Task

<GlobalCallout
  message='Describe what we needed to do to solve the problem'
  type='note'
/>

- Integrate Invoca (call tracking program) with our client’s CRM.
- Add “click to call” ad formats to our campaigns.
- Partner with the client to create a service catalog in CRM.
- Advise the client on how to best use the CRM to engage incoming conversions and track their progress.
- Facilitate regular sales enablement meetings with the client to improve campaign performance.

### Action

<GlobalCallout message='Explain how we solved the problem' type='note' />

We worked with the client to create tracking phone numbers that would be used for campaigns. We didn’t create a unique phone number for each ad group since that granularity was beyond the point of diminishing returns.

We also worked with the client to add their service catalog to the CRM. The services represented deliverables that their company offered with the price and profits. They were presented as items in a catalog in the CRM for salespeople to select, very similar to adding items to a shopping cart in an e-commerce website.

Incoming calls would automatically create a new contact in the CRM with a fake email address that followed this format: `{caller's phone number}@hubspot.com`.

Salespeople could search the incoming phone number in the CRM to find the contact and take notes on their record as usual. If the contact was ready to start talking about services they needed (very common), the salesperson could associate a deal with the contact and add services to the deal.

The salesperson would also ask for the caller’s email to update the fake one with a real one. This also informed the salesperson if the contact was already in the database. This would be used later to inform attribution since we didn’t assume 100% of the attribution from a returning customer.

The sales workflow would look similar to this simplified diagram:

This configuration resulted in completely deterministic conversion tracking. We knew what campaign was driving the conversions and were able to tie contacts back to that campaign. More importantly, we were able to track the revenue and profits generated by the deal associated with the contact, and tie that figure back to the ad campaign’s budget to prove **profits** generated (in addition to ROAS).

<GlobalCallout message='
Unlike systems that use trending data to assume conversions following an ad campaign, we were able to deterministically prove the exact dollar amount of revenue and profits generated. We could drill down to see which contacts generated how much revenue and tie that revenue to a specific campaign. Determining cost per conversion and campaign profitability was basic arithmetic at that point.

We regularly reviewed this information in bi-weekly sales enablement meetings and discussed the number of contacts generated from advertisements, the revenue they generated, the revenue in the pipeline from them, and the average time to close.

We would also use this call to talk about how each campaign was performing to cross-pollinate the success realized on one campaign to the others. In some instances, we would use low revenue yield as a factor in discontinuing campaigns.

Lastly, we would review specific contacts that were significant revenue drivers to find behavioral trends or demographics that could be used to inform audiences targeted in campaigns to predictably drive similar results more often.

### Result

<GlobalCallout message='Explain the outcome of the solution' type='note' />

The client saw over a 10X increase in revenue from ad campaigns in the two quarters following these enhancements.

We were able to give sufficient financial incentives for them to increase their advertising budget (”You gave me $100 for ads, I gave you $1,000 back in revenue.”). Due to the highly deterministic nature of our data, the client was compelled to invest increasing amounts of spend into advertising until their returns plateaued. Being as this client was billed based on commission, it quickly became one of the most valuable accounts at the agency.
