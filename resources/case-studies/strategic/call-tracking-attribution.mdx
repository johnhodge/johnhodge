This study discusses how we combined quick conversion touch-points with strategic CRM administration to drive conversions with deterministic tracking and sales revenue.

## Situation

<GlobalCallout message='Give context about the problem' type='note' />

We were working with a client who was primarily B2C (with some B2B sales) who only paid our agency a commission on ad budget. There was no retainer capacity allocated to the media strategy on this account.

Any friction in a conversion path can create attrition and result in leads being missed and sales not being captured. While we had strong conversion paths that would drive ad viewers to informative landing pages, we lacked quick frictionless conversions that could occur directly on the ad itself. Our advertisement campaigns were performing reasonably well, but using a shorter conversion path could increase conversions and as a result justify a larger ad budget.

But simply setting up shorter conversion paths wouldn&apos;t solve all our problems. Even if we were to set up quick, frictionless conversion points, we lacked the infrastructure needed to track those conversions and attribute sales to them. This would require some integration work and sales training.

## Task

<GlobalCallout
  message='Describe what we needed to do to solve the problem'

/>

- Integrate Invoca (call tracking program) to our client&apos;s CRM.
- Add “click to call” ad formats to our campaigns.
- Partner with client to create service catalog in CRM.
- Advise client on how to best use the CRM to engage incoming conversion and track their progress.
- Facilitate regular sales enablement meetings with client to improve campaign performance

## Action

<GlobalCallout message='Explain how we solved the problem' type='note' />

We worked with the client to create tracking numbers that would be used for campaigns. We didn&apos;t create a unique phone number for each ad group since that granularity was beyond the point of diminishing returns. It was much more cumbersome to manage than the value of the insights provided.

We also worked with the client to add their services to the CRM. These services represented deliverables that their company offered and were added to a menu that sales people could select from and add to a deal while talking with a prospect.

Incoming calls would create a new contact in the CRM dynamically with a fake email address that followed this format `{caller&apos;s phone numer}@hubspot.com`.

Sales people could search the incoming phone number in the CRM to find the contact and take notes on their record as usual. If the contact was ready to start talking about services they needed (very common), the sales person could associate a deal to the contact and add services to the deal.

The sales person would also ask for the callers email to update the fake one with a real one. This also informed the sales person if the contact was already in the database. This would be used later to inform attribution — we didn&apos;t assume 100% of the attribution from a returning customer.

The sales workflow would look similar to this simplified diagram:

This configuration made for completely deterministic conversion tracking. We knew what campaign was driving the conversions and were able to tie contacts back to that campaign. More importantly, we were able to track the revenue generated by the deal associated with the contact back to the ad campaign&apos;s budget.

Unlike in systems that use trending data to assume conversions following an ad campaign, we were able to prove the exact dollar amount of revenue generated. We could drill down to see which contacts generated revenue (and how much), and tie it to a direct result of specific campaigns.

We regularly reviewed this information in bi-weekly sales enablement meetings. We would discuss the number of contacts generated from advertisements, the revenue they generated, the revenue in the pipeline from them, and the average time to close.

Being as we had configured personas in their CRM, we were able to see this data by persona to see which segments were driving the most revenue the fastest.

We would also use this call to talk about how each campaign was performing to cross-pollinate success realized on one campaign to the others. In some instances, we would use low revenue yield as a factor in discontinuing campaigns.

Lastly, we would review specific contacts that were significant revenue drivers to find behavioral trends or demographics that could be used to inform audiences targeted in campaigns to predictably drive similar results more often.

## Result

<GlobalCallout message='Explain the outcome of the solution' type='note' />

The client saw over a 10X increase in revenue from ad campaigns in the two quarters following these enhancements.

We were able to give sufficient financial incentive for them to increase their advertising budget (”you gave me $100 for ads, I gave you $1,000 back in revenue”). Due to the highly deterministic nature of our data, the client was compelled to keep investing increasing amounts of money into advertising until their returns plateaued. Being as this client was billed based on commission (not all were billed this way), it quickly became one of the most valuable accounts at the agency.
