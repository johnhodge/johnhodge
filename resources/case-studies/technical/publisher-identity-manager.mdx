This study discusses how my team scaled publisher identity resolution to increase the proportion of inventory eligible for activation.

## STAR Analysis

This STAR analysis (situation, task, action, result) explains the product development work involved in creating a product for managing publishing identities

### Situation

<GlobalCallout message='Give context about the problem' type='note' />

To be able to target inventory being sent over RTB, our system needs incoming bundles to be associated with a publisher. This publisher is defined in our database and is described as being a group of bundles (along with some other metadata). These publishers are raised in the front end for targeting.

Aside from some far-off edge cases, a user has to target a publisher to be able to activate against inventory. This means that if an incoming bundle is not mapped to a publisher, it cannot be targeted or accessed.

Of the unique bundles entering our system, under 2% were mapped to a publisher.

Adding bundle to publisher associations has some considerations:

- It’s a highly manual process that involves an account manager guessing what bundles should be tied to what publishers, sharing a spreadsheet with their best guess with engineers, and engineers pushing those associations over a script that creates database rows.
- The existing process has no safety or validation measures, which can result in duplicate publishers (Discovery Channel vs. Discovery vs. The Discovery Channel), nothing is preventing one bundle from being tied to multiple publishers, among other issues.
- The current state of mapping has a profit impact. Since most of the inventory for a publisher is inaccessible, there isn’t as much competition between sources as possible, meaning we’re lucky to get a good price.

### Task

<GlobalCallout
  message='Describe what we needed to do to solve the problem.'
  type='note'
/>

Build a platform that allows users to manage publisher identities safely and at scale. This platform should support the following:

- Validation measures to ensure the publisher mapped to a bundle is the same one that already exists in our system.
- Bulk ingest publisher to bundle mappings over CSV ingest.
- Rename publishers and remove existing bundles from them (this effectively removes them from the user interface)

### Action

<GlobalCallout message='Explain how we solved the problem' type='note' />

#### Quick wins with ephemeral solutions

While we worked on the platform, I created an ephemeral solution for users that would add some validation checks. This was a Google Sheet that was connected to our database over a custom query. This query grabbed any existing publisher/bundle relationships and contained the publisher ID and name among other data points.

With some basic data validation and spreadsheet functions I was able to give the account team a spreadsheet where they could paste bundle IDs and it would tell them which ones were mapped and to what publisher. It also allowed them to use a drop-down to select the name and ID of the publisher an unmapped bundle should be associated to. This meant we had a similar publisher definition between the people determining the correct publisher and the engineering team that would be responsible for adding associations. New publisher additions could be requested in the notes column of the spreadsheet.

#### Publisher identity management platform

In this platform, there was a page that listed all the publishers in the system with a button to create a new publisher and view a publisher’s profile page. In this profile page, a user can change the name and adjust the bundles associated with the publisher. This included adding new bundles and associating them with the publisher.

#### Publisher identity bulk management

We created a program that would accept data from a CSV and push it to the database to manage publisher bundle associations at scale. This included…:

- Adding new bundles and associating them to a publisher
- Associating existing bundles to a publisher
- removing bundle associations from a publisher

This tool did not allow users to bulk create new publishers since that could cause issues with our front end if done at the level of scale supported by the ingest. Users could still create a new publisher in the platform and then reference it in a bulk ingest.

The required formatting accepted by this tool matched the output generated by the [app store data product](app-store-data) my team also created so that sensible associations could be inferred based on existing associations and exported from that product and then reingested into the publisher identity management product.

### Result

<GlobalCallout message='Explain the outcome of the solution' type='note' />

- The number of tickets to engineering to address publisher identity issues dropped by nearly 100% since this tool enabled account teams to fully manage publishers.
- The proportion of our inventory eligible for activation increased by more than 3x in just over a quarter after this tool became available.
- Engineering and Product were no longer involved in assigning relationships between publishers and bundles. This freed them up to work on other products.
