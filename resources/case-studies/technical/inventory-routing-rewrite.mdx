This case study discusses how my team rebuilt the inventory routing service to unlock full self-service SaaS capabilities for clients of an enterprise adtech provider (media buyers, planners, and strategists).

## Star Analysis

This STAR analysis (situation, task, action, result) explains the product development work involved in rewriting the inventory routing system.

### Situation

<GlobalCallout message='Give context about the problem' type='note' />

Inventory sources, like deals and VAST tags, were routed using literal strings in hard code. This routing system was integral to the entire platform since it was responsible for directing incoming requests (inventory) to the appropriate demand. Misconfigurations would interrupt service to entire inventory sources and every piece of demand relying on them would stop delivering as a result.

Many different kinds of criteria were supported with conditional logic flows and for loops (organization-level access, campaign-level access, inventory for political or elections, advertiser-specific deals, etc.). There were also thousands of deals and VAST integrations in the system. These led to thousands of lines of code which became hard to navigate and prone to errors.

Because of the above considerations, clients and account teams couldn’t self-manage inventory sources. As a result, the platform's SaaS offering was limited and the timeline to add new inventory was significantly longer than is acceptable. ENG was responsible for making these changes, and they frequently had competing priorities. Also, due to the sensitive nature of inventory routes, interacting with this code shouldn’t be rushed since mistakes can create duplicate work (at best), or interrupt service from new and existing inventory sources resulting in revenue loss.

Deals tended to represent inventory that would be sold in addition to existing media sales, meaning demand served would be net new additions to existing demand. Time spent not monetizing deals translated to missed net new revenue opportunities.

### Task

<GlobalCallout
  message='Describe what we needed to do to solve the problem.'
  type='note'
/>

Represent business logic of all required criteria with a program to read from the database and apply bidding logic accordingly.

Perform database architecture changes as needed and populate tables with the literal strings that were currently hard coded.

Expose CRUD functions over API to interact with the newly updated database.

### Action

<GlobalCallout message='Explain how we solved the problem' type='note' />

Due to the complexity of the requirements and sensitivity of the code, we ran this project with a phased approach. The phases are described below.

#### Build testing infrastructure for quick wins and safe development

First, we created some internal tooling for adding inventory to the database. This was a quick win that would allow non-ENG stakeholders to push inventory to the database.

Next, we built a safe environment for running long canaries against our updates to the routing logic. To do this, we cloned existing routing logic into its own function and compared the output of that function to the output of the legacy function, these should always match.

The output from these two functions was present in our Cloud Provider, but to make discrepancies more obvious ENG would send an alert to Slack when the outputs didn’t match. This ensured we were able to scale our diligence while we moved on to other phases. We used a two-week canary period, and if in that time no errors were raised to Slack, we deemed those program updates a success and moved on to the next set.

#### Campaign-level routes

In this phase, we built logic to read the inventory ID from the database and apply inventory targeting logic to a campaign.

To quickly capitalize on this new logic, we built an internal tool to allow other teams to manage targeting inventory on campaigns.

<GlobalCallout
  message='This would eventually be represented in the front-end platform in a targeting widget when the user is creating a campaign.'
  type='note'
/>

During our canary period, we would still add new inventory IDs to the legacy routing system to ensure that the new internal facing tooling behaved as expected.

#### Inventory parent-child hierarchy

In future phases, we’re going to need to associate hundreds of inventory IDs to organizations, to make these routes manageable, we’ll implement the concept of groups. For example, we would group the inventory owned by a media team, like Hearst, so that all of their inventory can be associated with their org by just referencing one ID (the parent). For media teams with hundreds of inventory IDs, this is crucial.

As usual, we would canary this functionality in the cloned version of the routing function. (I’m going to stop mentioning this for brevity because every phase is accompanied by a canary period.)

#### Exclusion logic

The parent-child relationships created in the previous phase will need to accommodate exclusion logic since there are instances where an org should have access to all IDs of a group, except one. Instead of needing to create entirely new groups for these organizations, we’ll want to use one as a broad group and apply exclusions to it.

This led to some fun discussions about how we should apply exclusion logic to the groups to achieve a desired end state and avoid creating any footguns.

For example, what happens when there are two groups targeted that have contradictory rules? Suppose one group included inventory ID `123` and the other group excluded inventory ID `123`.

- Do we apply it to the target or not?
- Should we add the concept of priority on groups so that one can take precedence over another?
- How would we know which group should be overridden?

After discussing with some users we realized that there may be use cases where the user wants to use a group to override the exclusion of another group, and some use cases where the user would want to override the inventory included in another group. We decided the best approach would be to apply the exclusion and raise an alert telling the user that there’s a conflict between the two groups.

#### Organization-level routes

These routes represent the inventory that an organization has access to. In this phase, we needed to break down what that access should look like. This is because an org might be getting access to inventory from a parent org by sharing an inventory group with the child. That parent org might not want the child to have visibility into the specific inventory items contained within the parent. This meant we would need to collaborate with the Access Controls product team to accommodate different levels of permissions.

With this in place, we were able to set varying levels of visibility and monetization rights safely and quickly with dashboards that displayed the permissions present on an inventory item.

#### Advertiser-level routes

Advertisers are just a specific kind of organization in the system, but their routes are nested inside their parent org. This means that while an advertiser (like Nike) can do work with many different organizations on our platform, there are different routes assigned to different instances of Nike based on the org they’re working with.

By treating the advertiser as a child of the platform organization, we were able to apply the appropriate routes to specific advertisers. This meant that if Nike was booking a campaign, it would only source inventory that I sourced (in addition to inventory made generally available across the platform). I wouldn’t see campaigns from Lincoln deliver into my inventory.

### Result

<GlobalCallout message='Explain the outcome of the solution' type='note' />

Shortening the time to revenue realized on new inventory sources from about six weeks to about three days.

Based on the average revenue realized per inventory source per month, this likely equated to over $10M per year.
