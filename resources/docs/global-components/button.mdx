import GlobalCallout from '@/app/resources/components/callouts';

The button component in this project is named `GlobalButton` and is used to style buttons for linking and user interactions.

## Component Spec

There are three kinds of button `link`, `route`, and `button`. For `button`, the component will look similar to this:

```javascript
<GlobalButton
  text='Try again'
  size='small'
  color='gray'
  width='fit'
  buttonType='button'
  onClick={() => reset()}
/>
```

For `link` or `route`, the component will look like this.

```javascript
<GlobalButton
  text='Get in touch'
  size='small'
  color='primary'
  width='fit'
  buttonType='route' //or 'link'
  href='#contact'
/>
```

<GlobalCallout
  message='The difference between `link` and `route` is that `link` uses a normal `<a>` tag while route uses the `<Link>` component from Nextjs to handle routing.'
  type='note'
/>

For full spec, see the `types.ts` file.

## Styling Buttons

Button’s don’t accept a `className` prop (or similar). Styles are all applied using objects that map to values past through the props of the component.

For example, width styles are configured on an object similar to this:

```javascript
const widthStyle = { fit: 'w-fit', full: 'w-full' };
```

And applied to HTML by calling the value from the corresponding key of the `width` prop, like this:

```html
<Link className={`${widthStyle[props.width]} ...`}>...</Link>
```

## Using Button types

Each button type is meant to be used in set situations.

### Route

This component links pages together with a route that supports pre-fetching and client-side navigation. The result is a website that feels more like an application with seamless navigation between pages linked with this button type.

This is the most common button type and is used to set up routing between pages.

<GlobalCallout
  message='This button type is powered using the [`Link` component available through Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/link), which simplifies the process of creating routes.'
  type='note'
/>

### Link

This component links pages together with a traditional anchor tag. The result is that the entire page has to load and there is no support for pre-fetching or client-side navigation. The result is that HTML is completely re-rendered for the linked destination.

This component is uncommon and should only be used when specific needs require it.

### Button

This component supports on-page functionality that doesn’t link pages but rather supports events like [`onClick`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/onclick) to enable user interactions of some sort.

## Global Components

This component is used in both the [`GlobalCard`](card) and [`GlobalDialog`](dialog) components.

### GlobalCard

This component is used on the [`GlobalCard`](card) component to send buttons to the [`GlobalDialog`](dialog) component for closing the dialog and linking CTAs.

### GlobalDialog

This component is used on the [`GlobalDialog`](dialog) component as the button that opens the dialog.

## Known Limitations

The below known limitations have been added to Jira and are being prioritized against other competing initiatives.

### Prop Drilling

<GlobalCallout
  message='Prop drilling on this component is a broader concern that needs to be addressed with the [`GlobalCard`](card) component in mind.'
  type='alert'
/>

The way this component is used on other components has led to prop drilling which has resulted in some cumbersome coding logic and messy ternary statements. This is an enhancement that’s being tracked against other items in the backlog.
